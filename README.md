# Emoji_Predictor
In today’s world where short messages and instagram pictures are at the heart of social media interactions, emojis have become the cardinal forms of expression of ideas and emotions. They penetrate language barriers and allow people to express a whole lot in a very succinct manner.

This project aims to suggest emojis based on the given text by analyzing the sentiment of the given text and predicting relevant emojis for it.
